# Photos Folder

Place your photos here with the following names:
- photo-1.jpg
- photo-2.jpg
- photo-3.jpg

Or update the image paths in the HTML files to match your photo names.

## Tips:
- Use high-quality images (they'll be resized automatically)
- Square or landscape photos work best
- Recommended size: 800x600 pixels or larger
