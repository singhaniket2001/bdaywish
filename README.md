## Customization Guide

### Step 3: Update the Birthday Date

Open `home.js` and find the countdown configuration:

```javascript
// Change this to their birthday
const birthdayDate = new Date('January 25, 2025 00:00:00');
```

### Step 4: Update Names and Messages

#### In `index.html`:
```html
<!-- Change the name -->
<h1>Happy Birthday [THEIR NAME]</h1>

<!-- Change the greeting -->
<p class="nickname-text">To my favorite [NICKNAME]</p>

<!-- Change your signature -->
<p class="from-text">- From [YOUR NAME]</p>

<!-- Change the age -->
<div class="level-up-badge">Level [AGE] Unlocked!</div>
```

#### In `wishes.html`:
Update the title and name:
```html
<h1>Happy Birthday [THEIR NAME]</h1>
```

#### In `memories.html`:
Update the final message section:
```html
<h2>Happy [AGE]th Birthday, [THEIR NAME]!</h2>
<p class="signature">- [YOUR NAME]</p>
```

### Step 5: Add Your Photos

1. Add your photos to the `photos/` folder
2. Rename them to match the template:
   - `photo-1.jpg`
   - `photo-2.jpg`
   - `photo-3.jpg`
3. Or update the image paths in HTML files

### Step 6: Customize Photo Captions

In `memories.html`, update the memory cards:

```html
<div class="memory-card">
    <img src="./photos/photo-1.jpg" alt="Description" class="memory-img">
    <div class="memory-date">[DATE OR TITLE]</div>
    <div class="memory-caption">[YOUR CAPTION HERE]</div>
</div>
```

### Step 7: Add Birthday Wishes/Reasons

In `wishes.js`, update the reasons array:

```javascript
const reasons = [
    "Because your smile lights up my day",
    "Because you always know how to make me laugh",
    "Because you're the best listener",
    "Because you give the warmest hugs",
    "Because you believe in me",
    // Add more reasons...
];
```

### Step 8: Add Background Music (Optional)

## Color Customization

The default theme uses pink/purple colors. To change:

### In CSS files, find and replace:

| Current Color | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `#ff69b4` | Hot Pink (primary) |
| `#ff99cc` | Light Pink |
| `#da70d6` | Orchid |
| `#ffd1dc` | Pale Pink |

### Example: Blue Theme

Replace:
- `#ff69b4` → `#4169e1` (Royal Blue)
- `#ff99cc` → `#87ceeb` (Sky Blue)
- `#da70d6` → `#6495ed` (Cornflower Blue)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Music Not Playing?
Modern browsers block autoplay. The music toggle button lets users enable it manually.

### Images Not Loading?
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure images are in the correct folder
- Use lowercase extensions (.jpg, not .JPG)

### Countdown Shows Wrong Time?
- Make sure the date format is correct: `'Month Day, Year HH:MM:SS'`
- Check your timezone considerations

## Tips for the Best Experience

1. **Use high-quality photos** - They'll be displayed prominently
2. **Write personal messages** - Generic wishes are forgettable
3. **Test on mobile** - Many people will view on phones
4. **Send the link privately** - Makes it more special
5. **Time it right** - Send at midnight or morning of their birthday
